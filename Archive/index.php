                    <p class="content-para">Outsourcing is the process of delegating a company's business process to third parties or external agencies, leveraging benefits ranging from low cost labor, improved quality to product and service innovation. When outsourcing transgresses national boundaries and is managed by companies located in other countries, outsourcing takes the form of offshoring.</p>
                    <p class="content-para">A hotly debated topic with pros and cons, both outsourcing as well as offshoring have a direct impact on a company's top and bottom line and have become key components of defining how successful enterprises are run. Given below, as reflected by companies, are the top 10 reasons to outsource:</p>
                    <p class="content-number"><span class="number">1.</span> Lower operational and labor costs are among the primary reasons why companies choose to outsource. When properly executed it has a defining impact on a company's revenue recognition and can deliver significant savings</p>
